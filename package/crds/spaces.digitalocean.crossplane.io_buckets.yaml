                  THIS IS A BETA FIELD. It is on by default but can be opted out

                  ManagementPolicies specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to
                  take on the managed and external resources.
                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future
                  release. Currently, both could be set independently and non-default
                  values would be honored if the feature flag is enabled. If both are
                  custom, the DeletionPolicy field will be ignored.
